//! Per-agent config writers: the trait, the registry, and the concrete
//! writers.
//!
//! Each supported agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, opencode)
//! implements [`AgentConfigWriter`]. The orchestrator in
//! [`crate::cli`] iterates [`default_writers`], gating each call on
//! [`AgentConfigWriter::presence`] so an absent agent is reported as
//! skipped without ever touching the filesystem.
//!
//! The trait deliberately splits the three verbs so each is independently
//! testable, and returns structured outcomes (not pre-formatted strings) so
//! the CLI owns presentation and the exit-code policy in one place.
