//! Resolves the platform-specific data directory via `runtime_paths` and

//! `crate::telemetry::id::telemetry_id()` and
//! `crate::telemetry::id::telemetry_id_with_first_run()` unchanged.

/// returns the persisted value. If anything goes wrong (no data dir, file
/// unwritable, file contents invalid), returns an ephemeral UUID for this
/// session and logs at DEBUG - the caller treats the subsystem as "running
