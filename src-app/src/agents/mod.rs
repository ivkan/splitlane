//! Agents-view support modules that survived the removal of the in-app
//! ACP chat and the "Connect" discovery shell. The conversation
//! timeline, composer, message/tool rendering, the persisted ACP
//! runtime, and the sign-in/welcome surface were all deleted when the
//! Agents view became terminal-only (each thread launches a CLI agent
//! in a PTY - see [`crate::agent_launcher`]).
//!
//! What remains:
//! - [`notifications`] - desktop-notification routing and visibility gates.
//! - `mac_notifications` - the macOS delivery backend behind it.
//! - [`parent_guard`] - process-parent death guards for PTYs and agent CLIs.
