//! JSON-RPC socket server for AI agent control.
//!
//! Listens on `<runtime_dir>/splitlane/splitlane.sock` on Unix and
//! `\\.\pipe\splitlane` on Windows. Each connection reads
//! newline-delimited JSON-RPC requests and writes responses.
//!
//! Cross-platform IPC is handled by the `interprocess` crate's
//! `local_socket` module, which dispatches to Unix domain sockets on
//! POSIX and named pipes on Windows transparently. The wire protocol
//! (newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0) is byte-identical across platforms.
//!
//! ## Trust model - local-only, owner-UID enforcement
//!
//! The IPC server is **strictly local**: it has no network surface,
//! no port binding, no remote identity. Trust derives entirely from
//! filesystem and kernel-credential boundaries:
//!
//! - **Socket file mode 0600** (Unix): set immediately after bind in
//!   `bind_socket`. Non-owner processes on the same machine cannot
//!   `connect()` past the kernel filesystem check.
//! - **Peer-UID enforcement** (Unix): every accepted connection runs
//!   `getsockopt(SO_PEERCRED)` (Linux) / `LOCAL_PEERCRED` (macOS) and
//!   compares the peer's UID to the server's. A mismatch returns a
//!   JSON-RPC `-32001 permission denied` error envelope and closes
//!   the stream BEFORE any method dispatches. Defence-in-depth - if a
//!   privileged third party bypasses the file-mode check
//!   (e.g. CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, mode-fixing automation), the kernel
//!   credential check still rejects them.
//! - **Windows** uses Named Pipes with an explicit SDDL security
//!   descriptor for LocalSystem, Administrators, and the object owner.
//!   We do not rely on the platform default DACL.
//!
//! No HMAC tokens, no TLS - both would add complexity without
//! meaningful gain on a local-only socket. If the IPC ever grows a
//! network surface, that decision must be revisited.
//!
//! ## Per-method blast radius
//!
//! The trust model above gates *who* can connect (same-UID only). It
//! does NOT gate *what* an authorised client can do. The methods
//! below carry different blast radii once connected:
//!
//! - `system.*`: read-only health checks. Safe.
//! - `workspace.list` / `workspace.current` / `workspace.select` /
//!   `workspace.close`: navigation + workspace lifecycle. Visible
//!   side effects on the UI; no file/system mutation.
//! - `workspace.create`: spawns a PTY at `cwd`. `cwd` is
//!   canonicalised and rejected if not a directory.
//! - `surface.split`: layout mutation, bounded by `MAX_PANES`. Bare layout
//!   splits are navigation-level; spawn fields are gated like `workspace.up`.
//! - `workspace.up`: multi-pane creation. Navigation-only pane specs are
//!   allowed for same-UID clients, but `command`, `prompt`, `context`, and
//!   non-empty `env` are orchestration primitives gated behind
//!   `SPLITLANE_IPC_ORCHESTRATION=1`. `SPLITLANE_IPC_SCRIPTING=1` also enables
//!   them as a broader legacy opt-in.
//! - **`surface.send_text` / `surface.send_keystroke`: same-UID RCE
//!   primitive when enabled.** A connected client can inject
//!   arbitrary bytes (including `\n`) into any visible PTY,
//!   effectively running any shell command in the user's
//!   privileges. These are gated behind the
//!   `SPLITLANE_IPC_SCRIPTING=1` opt-in env var; when unset (the
//!   default), the handlers return JSON-RPC error
//!   `-32601 Method not enabled`. The intended consumer is the
//!   trusted same-UID `splitlane-ai-hook` binary; the wrapper
//!   installer can set the env var on the user's behalf with a
//!   visible prompt. `surface.send_keystroke` additionally
//!   rejects CRLF bytes regardless of the opt-in (CRLF injection
//!   bypass guard).
//! - `ai.*`: lifecycle telemetry from the AI hook. Read-only on
//!   the host UI side; safe.
//!
//! ## Methods
//!
//! - `system.ping` / `system.capabilities` / `system.identify` - stateless
//!   health checks handled directly on the socket thread.
//! - `workspace.list` / `workspace.current` / `workspace.select` /
//!   `workspace.close` - workspace navigation.
//! - `workspace.create` - accepts `name` (string, default "Terminal"),
//!   `cwd` (string path, optional) and `layout` (optional `LayoutNode`
//!   JSON). When `layout` is present, the new workspace's pane
//!   tree is built from the layout in a single round-trip; when absent,
//!   behavior is unchanged (a single default pane). A malformed `layout`
//!   payload returns the JSON-RPC `-32602 Invalid params` error envelope
//!   and leaves no orphan workspace behind.
//! - `workspace.restore_layout` - apply a `LayoutNode` to the active
//!   workspace (used by session restore).
//! - `surface.list` / `surface.send_text` / `surface.send_keystroke` /
//!   `surface.split` - pane operations.
//! - `ai.session_start` / `ai.prompt_submit` / `ai.tool_use` /
//!   `ai.notification` / `ai.stop` / `ai.exit` / `ai.session_end` - AI
//!   hook lifecycle (`ai.exit` carries the wrapped agent binary's real
//!   exit status).
//!
//! Handlers may return a structured JSON-RPC error by emitting the
//! `_jsonrpc_error` sentinel (see `app::ipc_handler::JsonRpcError`); the
//! dispatcher promotes it to a proper `error` envelope. Legacy
//! application errors returned as `{"error": "string"}` are also promoted
//! so clients never treat failures as successful `result` payloads.
