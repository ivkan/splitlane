//! Debug-only pixel-coordinate probe.
//!
//! Records the actual coordinates submitted to GPUI so a future rendering
//! investigation starts from data, not hypothesis. Six block-character fixes
//! were attempted on guesswork and reverted before this probe existed; that is
//! the pattern this module exists to prevent.
//!
//! ## Activation
//!
//! Two independent env vars, read once at first call into `OnceLock<bool>`s
//! (matches the `SPLITLANE_LATENCY_PROBE` idiom at `terminal/view.rs`):
//!
//! - `SPLITLANE_PIXEL_PROBE=1` enables structured `log::debug!` records on the
//!   `splitlane::pixel_probe` target. Display them with
//!   `RUST_LOG=splitlane::pixel_probe=debug`.
//! - `SPLITLANE_PIXEL_PROBE_OVERLAY=1` (independent - NOT activated by the
//!   first var alone) enables a translucent red bounds overlay above every
//!   cell after the text pass.
//!
//! The whole module is gated `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` at its parent
//! declaration, so release builds compile to a no-op (zero runtime cost,
//! the symbols never link).
//!
//! ## Output volume
//!
//! Per repaint of a single terminal element:
//! - One `cell_dims` line carrying both the raw measured values and the
//!   integer-snapped values, plus `scale_factor`.
//! - One `origin` line carrying the gutter-adjusted grid origin.
//! - One `glyph` line per text run whose first column is below
//!   `ROW_SAMPLE_LIMIT` (16). Bounds log volume on wide terminals.
//! - One `bg` line per background rect whose first column is below the same
//!   limit. Same rationale.
//! - One `block_quad` line per block quad (already low-cardinality).
