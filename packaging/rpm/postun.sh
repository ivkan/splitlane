#!/bin/sh
# RPM `%postun` scriptlet - runs after the package files are removed.
# Rebuilds the freedesktop icon + desktop caches so the vanishing
# `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/splitlane.png` entries and the
# removed `splitlane.desktop` stop being surfaced by GNOME Shell / KDE
# Plasma / docks / launchers.
#
# Scriptlet argument conventions:
#   $1 = 0  → final uninstall (the package is going away for good)
#   $1 = 1  → upgrade in progress (a newer version was just written;
#             its own %post already refreshed the caches, so this run
#             would be redundant but still harmless)
#
# We unconditionally refresh: the `-f` flag makes rebuild idempotent
# and the extra ~50 ms on upgrade is cheaper than a cache-state bug.
# The `|| true` guard keeps the transaction green on minimal distros
# that don't ship these tools.
